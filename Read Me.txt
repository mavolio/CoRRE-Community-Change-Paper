Here is all the code to accompany Avolio et al. 2021. Determinants of community compositional change are equally affected by global change.

The R files are run in this order.

1. RAC Changes.R

Due to the nature of a large collaborative database, not all datasets are public, therefore the initial data to create the dataset of community changes is not public. 
This code is uses the codyn fucntions to get the main dataset of community changes used in all subsequent analyses. At the end there are additional checks on the analyses.
